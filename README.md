# Parham's Frontend assignments.
I'm currently looking for getting relocation job in frontend stacks from the europe.
I'll update my projects here as I submit them for the companies, I think it would be ~10 before I get a real job-offer in 2023.
so feel free to use the code, I'll provide the number so you can follow my progress writing demonstrative codes that amaze the reviewer.
if you are the reviewer, just ignore this line :D I want to help people and make my Github profile look better.
